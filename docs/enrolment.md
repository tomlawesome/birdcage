# Enrolling a canary

Issue #47 slice 1b's flow for turning a fresh box into a canary: birdcage
mints a one-time deploy token, you paste one command on the canary host,
and the canary uses that token to introduce itself to birdcage exactly
once.

## Before the first canary

Two things need to be set once, before `birdcage canary enrol` will do
anything:

**1. The two enrolment addresses (issue #54).** `POST /enrol/hello`
hands these to a freshly enrolled canary so its operator knows where an
admin approval and a release each go. Set them with:

```
birdcage settings set admin_approval_address "<your address>"
```

```
birdcage settings set release_address "<your address>"
```

`birdcage canary enrol` refuses to mint a token until both are set, and
tells you so.

**2. `BIRDCAGE_ADVERTISE_HOST`.** The hostname or IP the canary reaches
this birdcage instance on -- see
[docs/configuration.md](configuration.md#birdcage_advertise_host). Set it
in birdcage's own environment before starting it.

## Enrolling a canary

On the machine running birdcage:

```
birdcage canary enrol
```

This prints a `docker run` command and one line underneath it saying how
long the token is valid. It looks like this (values differ every time):

```
docker run -d --name mockingbird --restart unless-stopped --init \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0 \
  -v mockingbird-state:/var/lib/mockingbird -v mockingbird-log:/var/log/opencanary \
  -e MOCKINGBIRD_BIRDCAGE_URL=https://203.0.113.10:8444 \
  -e MOCKINGBIRD_CA_PIN=<64 hex characters -- the CA's SHA-256 pin> \
  -e MOCKINGBIRD_DEPLOY_TOKEN=<64 hex characters -- shown once, single-use> \
  mockingbird:latest
token valid for 5 minutes (until 2026-09-19T06:58:08Z); single use
```

Copy the whole `docker run` block and paste it into a shell on the box
you want to turn into a canary. That's it -- the canary's agent
(mockingbird) takes it from there: it dials birdcage at the address and
pin given, presents the deploy token once, and gets back everything it
needs to keep going.

## Why the token is single-use and five minutes

The deploy token is a bearer credential: whoever has it can claim the
canary identity it mints. Two limits keep the window it's dangerous in
as small as possible:

- **Five minutes.** If the `docker run` command isn't pasted and run
  within five minutes of printing, the token stops working and
  `birdcage canary enrol` has to be run again for a fresh one.
- **Single use.** The moment the canary presents the token, it is burned
  -- pasting the same command a second time (on the same box, or by
  mistake on a different one) is refused, and birdcage logs it as a
  token-reuse event.

## Where the token stays visible until it's burned

Until the canary makes contact, the raw token exists in a few places you
should be aware of:

- **Your shell history**, since you pasted the whole command.
- **`docker inspect mockingbird`**, since it's an environment variable on
  the running container -- anyone with access to the Docker daemon on
  that box can read it out.

Neither of these matters once the token is burned (it stops being usable
the instant first contact succeeds), but if you're worried about either
in the meantime, clear your shell history after pasting and treat the
box as holding a live credential until the container's logs show it
connected.

## Checking on enrolment sessions

```
birdcage canary enrol --status
```

Lists every enrolment session -- id, state, when it was minted, its
deadlines -- without ever printing a token or a hash. Useful for
confirming a session was actually contacted, or for seeing one expire
after being forgotten.
